### [v2.0.0] - 2025-09-01

#### Added
- Command-based configuration generation using a stub-driven strategy to maintain a cleaner file hierarchy and prevent bloated single configuration files. A new `AddNewModule` command (located in the Commands folder) allows developers to generate module-specific configuration files by providing interactive input. Each execution of the command will create a dedicated configuration file using predefined stubs in appropriate folders.
  - Command: `php artisan datafinder:add-new-module`
- A general stub handler helper to have reuseable methods to generate and publish files through stubs.
- Added functions in `ConfigGlobal.php`
  - `getPath`
  - `createDirectoryIfNotExist`
- Added the buttons column in table on frontend as a default column but based on the option in `configuration file`.
- Improved validation for filters during data retrieval to exclude empty values and unselected fields from the filter object. This prevents ambiguity when searching or filtering against empty or null values.
- RefreshPackage command is added in the package to allow users to update package assets (publishable) upon new release using command.
  - Command: `php artisan datafinder:assets-refresh`
- Now supports conditional functions like where, groupBy, having including aggregate support for primary table.
- Added an option to enable and disable the text-based search in datatable in frontend configuration file.

#### Changed
- File name:
  - `DataLayerService.php` to `DataFinderService.php`.
- Function in ConfigGlobal.php:
    - `validateConfigFile`: change the way, path was genertaed and used a new reuseable function called getPath.
- Function in `ConfigParser.php`:
  - `getTableColumnsConfiguration`: added the orderable key in the mapping callback to return orderable status for columns.
- Function name in `DataSearchController.php`:
  - `liveSearchTableRender` to `data`.
- Renamed key for buttons in records collection:
  - `options` to `actions`
- Renamed route name to get data in the datatable:
  - `liveSearchTableRender` to `df/data`
- Renamed route name to export data:
  - `export/init` to `df/export/init`
- Updated new routes in package's datatable support files in js for data fetch and export.
- Renamed Code of Conduct.md file.
- `SubQueryTrait` has now convert to `DFQueryBuilder` class to cover not just the creation of query for subqueries-joins but also for primary query now using one single file following the code reusability approach.
  - Implemented new builder to `JoinTrait` and `DataFinderService` 
- Enhanced `DataFinderTrait` to cover only the functions that are functionality for Datafinder but not the core features
- Enhanced `ConfigParser` by adding a new function which will return all the nessecary items required by the package configuration in single call, saving memory utilizations and recalling of the config file repitition.

#### Fixed
- If no default value is given for filter type input text, then ask the value from end user to input
- Validation message variable name fix from `file_not_exisit_message` to `file_not_exist_message`
- fixed bugs in stubs structure and their file includes.
