## _Introduction_

**[DataFinder](https://datafinder.suhk.me/)** is an innovative and highly efficient Laravel package that simplifies complex data operations by bringing advanced search, filtering, and retrieval capabilities into a single, developer-friendly solution. It eliminates the need for writing repetitive query logic by bridging backend queries with dynamic, customizable front-end tables.  

Built on top of Laravel‚Äôs robust **Eloquent Query Builder** and seamlessly integrated with **[DataTables](https://datatables.net/)**, DataFinder ensures performance and scalability even when working with millions of records. Its modular configuration approach makes it easy to define relationships, filters, conditional queries, exports, and custom row actions & more, all from a configuration structure per module. It allows developers to focus on delivering insights and features rather than wrestling with data pipelines, making it a go-to solution for modern, data-driven applications.


### **_Key Features_**

#### **_Core Features (Developer Essentials)_**
*Everything developers need to build fast, flexible, and reliable data-driven modules.*

üîç **Dynamic Multi-Table Search**  
Seamlessly query across multiple database tables with **automatic JOINs**, delivering fast and relevant results without extra boilerplate.

üîé **Advanced Multi-Filter Search**  
Stack multiple filters with multi-value support, combining **filter-based** and **text-based search** across single or multiple tables, giving users ultimate flexibility in refining data.

üìä **Conditional & Aggregate Queries**  
Full support for `where`, `groupBy`, `having`, and aggregate functions makes it easy to build anything from **simple filters** to **complex analytical reports**.

‚ö° **Flexible Table Configurations**  
Define models, relationships, searchable columns, and filters inside a **single modular config file per module**, cutting down setup time and ensuring consistency.

üéØ **Custom Row Actions**  
Create interactive row-level actions (like edit, approve, export, etc.) directly in your tables, enabling **seamless workflows** inside your application.

---

#### üè¢ Enterprise Value (Performance & Scale)
*Designed for scalability, maintainability, and enterprise-grade performance.*

üìà **Optimized for Performance & Scale**  
Built to handle **millions of records** efficiently, ensuring fast search and exports even for enterprise-scale datasets.

‚ö° **Advanced Data Exporting (CSV, XLSX, XLS)**  
Export small or large datasets ‚Äî from simple queries to **complex joins, filters, and conditionals**, all from the same modular configuration.

üöÄ **Intuitive Module Setup**  
One config = everything. Columns, joins, filters, exports, and row actions can all be defined per module, making integration **faster, cleaner, and scalable**.

üì¶ **One-Command Setup**  
Install, configure, and refresh with **single Artisan commands**. Perfect for fast onboarding and easy upgrades.

### Why DataFinder?

Building **searchable, filterable, and exportable data modules** in modern applications is often repetitive, time-consuming, and inconsistent across projects.  
DataFinder solves this by providing a **plug-and-play, configuration-driven solution** that makes data exploration as simple as writing one config file.

 **For Developers**: No need to reinvent advanced search, joins, and exports. Focus on business logic, not boilerplate.  
 **For Teams**: Standardized, reusable configs mean faster onboarding, less code debt, and predictable results.  
 **For Enterprises**: Built to scale with **millions of records**, efficient exports, and modular architecture for long-term maintainability.  
 **For Investors**: DataFinder reduces engineering overhead, accelerates delivery timelines, and enables applications to monetize faster with enterprise-grade data handling.
